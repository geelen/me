  "bio": "I'm an independent web developer from Melbourne, Australia, with a background in mathematical simulations and distributed computing. Since 2009, I've been working exclusively on the web and most recently, almost entirely on the front-end. I think there's never been a more potent target for ideas than the browser and the web, and I love the incredible pace at which new ideas are emerging, and the new ways ideas can be demonstrated, shared and built upon. I run the Melbourne AngularJS meetup and am an organiser of CSSConf AU."
